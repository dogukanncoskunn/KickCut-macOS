//! The download engine: segments to disk, pausable, resumable, queued.
//!
//! Resume is the requirement that shaped this. A three-hour 1080p60 clip is
//! tens of gigabytes over an hour or more, and an hour of work that cannot
//! survive a pause - let alone a reboot - is not really a download at all.
//!
//! So there is no separate progress file to keep in step with reality. **The
//! segment files on disk are the state.** A segment is written as `N.part` and
//! renamed to `N.ts` only once it is complete, so a `.ts` is finished by
//! construction: resuming means listing the directory, and a crash mid-write
//! costs one segment. That also removes any need for byte-range resume - at
//! roughly 10 MB a segment there is nothing worth salvaging from a partial one.
//!
//! Jobs run one at a time. Two large downloads sharing a connection finish no
//! sooner together than in sequence, and one finishing early is far more useful
//! than both finishing late.
