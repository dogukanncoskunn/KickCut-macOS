//! Turning downloaded segments into one MP4 an editor can work with.
//!
//! Two things matter here, and the first is not a flag.
//!
//! **The segments are joined into one transport stream before ffmpeg sees
//! them.** Handing ffmpeg's concat demuxer a list of segment files instead is
//! the obvious approach, and it stamps 60 fps content as 59.95 fps - a 0.08%
//! error that an editor turns into progressive audio desync, about nine seconds
//! across three hours. See `join_segments` for the measurements. This was found
//! by someone editing a real recording, not by reading the code.
//!
//! **`-bsf:a aac_adtstoasc`** is the flag that is genuinely needed. AAC inside
//! a transport stream is framed as ADTS and MP4 expects a raw
//! AudioSpecificConfig; copying the frames across without converting leaves an
//! ADTS header on every packet. Players tolerate that, editors do not.
//!
//! `-movflags +faststart` moves the index to the front so an editor can open
//! the file without reading to the end first.
//!
//! Nothing else rewrites timestamps. `+genpts`, `-avoid_negative_ts` and
//! `-video_track_timescale` used to be here and are deliberately gone: they
//! existed to correct artefacts the concat demuxer introduced, and with one
//! continuous input there is nothing to correct. The stream already carries the
//! timestamps the broadcaster's encoder wrote.
//!
//! Where a copy still cannot win is across a discontinuity that changes the
//! encode itself. For that there is the re-encode mode, offered whenever the
//! chosen range spans a break.

/// 23400 video frames, 18282 audio frames - but with different timestamps:
///
///   concat demuxer   video 390.314 s   =>  59.9517 fps
///   joined stream    video 390.000 s   =>  60.0001 fps
///
/// The audio is unaffected either way; its length follows from the sample count
/// at 48 kHz and came out identical to the millisecond. So the video runs 0.08%
/// slow against it, and that is a rate error, not an offset: it accumulates.
/// Over a three-hour recording it is roughly nine seconds.
///
/// The cause is that the demuxer rebases every entry by the duration its
/// container *reports*, and an MPEG-TS segment reports slightly more than it
/// holds - about 7.6 ms per segment here. A player never shows it, because a
/// player honours each frame's own timestamp. An editor does, because it
/// conforms the video to a constant rate: Premiere divides 23400 frames by
/// 390.314 s, lays them out at 59.95 fps, and runs the audio at its true rate
/// beside them. That is the progressive drift that was reported - correct at
/// the start, obviously wrong hours in.
///
